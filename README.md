# zulip-bot-kaomoji
Zulip bot to replace commands by kaomojis.  
Simply put, replaces messages like `/shrug` with `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`, for example.

## Instructions
To work on this bot, follow the following instructions to setup you environment:

1. `pip install virtualenv`
1. `virtualenv venv`
1. `source venv/bin/activate`
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After you’re done working for the moment, don’t forget to `$ deactivate`.
